      <h1>Introduction to HTML</h1>
    <P>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. 
        For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points,
         or using images and data tables. <br>          As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic 
         understanding of HTML and its functions.
        </P>
        <h2>So what is HTML?</h2>
        <P>HTML is a <strong>markup language</strong> that defines the structure of your content.
             HTML consists of a series of <em>elements</em>, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.  For example, take the following line of content:</P>

         <p>The main part of an HTML element as follows</p>
         <ol>
             <li> <strong>The opening tag:</strong>  This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.</li>
             <li> <strong>The closing tag:</strong> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.</li>

         </ol>
         <h2>Summary</h2>
         <p>You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a <strong> element, which means that the word is to be strongly emphasized:

         </p>
         <p> 
             <ul>
                 <li>Hello</li>
                 <li>How are you?</li>
             </ul>
         </p>
